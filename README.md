# 🧩 Welcome to my C# Sandbox 🩴🩴

## ❔ What is it?
> A space to store my C# programs, explore new ideas, and document my ongoing programming journey.  
> Here I work through concepts ranging from foundational syntax to object-oriented design and database connectivity.

---

## 📁 Contents
> This repository includes programs created throughout my college studies and independent learning.  
> Each file reflects steady growth in logic, structure, and understanding of core C# concepts.

---

The plan is to expand into **database integration** and **data-driven apps**, and eventually include a **final project** that ties many of these concepts together.  

--- 

## ▶️ Running the Programs (🚨 important!)
Each exercise is stored in its own folder with a `Program.cs` file.

To run any exercise:
1. Open the folder in VS Code or your terminal.
2. Run the following command:
```
dotnet run
```
