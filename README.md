# 🧩 Welcome to my C# Sandbox 🩴🩴

## ❔ What is it?
> A space to store my C# programs, explore new ideas, and document my ongoing programming journey.  
> Here I work through concepts ranging from foundational syntax to object-oriented design and database connectivity.

---

## 📁 Contents
> This repository includes programs created throughout my college studies and independent learning.  
> Each file reflects steady growth in logic, structure, and understanding of core C# concepts.

---

The plan is to expand into **database integration** and **data-driven apps**, and eventually include a **final project** that ties many of these concepts together.  

--- 

## ▶️ Running the Programs (🚨 important!)
Each exercise is stored as its own `.cs` file and can be run individually.

To test any exercise:
1. Copy its contents into your local `Program.cs` file in VS Code.
2. Then run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```
