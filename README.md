### ⛱️ **Welcome to my C# Sandbox** 🩴🩴

→ **Description**  
A space to store my `C# programs`, explore new ideas, and document my ongoing programming journey.  
Here I work through concepts ranging from foundational syntax to object-oriented design and database connectivity.  

#### 📁 **Contents**  
This repository includes programs created throughout my college studies and independent learning.  
Each file reflects steady growth in logic, structure, and understanding of core C# concepts.  

The plan is to expand into database integration and data-driven apps, and eventually include a final project that ties many of these concepts together.  

---

#### **Running the Programs (🚨 Important!)**
Each exercise is stored as its own `.cs` file and for simplification and must be run individually in a Program.cs file (using vs code)

#### ⚙️**Setup & Run**
```
To run any C# program locally from your device, you must first follow these simple steps 👇  

1. Install the .NET SDK  
→  [Download free here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
Once downloaded, test with CLI command: dotnet --version

2️. Create a New Console Project
dotnet new console -n MyApp
cd MyApp

3️. Replace the Default Program.cs
Insert/build desired script into the freshly generated Program.cs file.

4️. Run the Program
dotnet run
✅ Your output should appear in the terminal.
```

#### 💡 Quick Tips
If you only want to test one file at a time, just:
- Keep one main folder (i.e. MyApp/).
- Copy the code you want to test into Program.cs.
- Run w/:  `dotnet run` command

That’s the fastest way to experiment.

#### 📘 About
This repository will grow gradually, with new files added after completion or submission.
Some projects are my own, others are assignments designed to solve specific problems.
