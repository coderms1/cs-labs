🧩 **Welcome to my C# Sandbox** 🩴🩴  
❔ **What is it?**  
A space to store my `C# programs`, explore new ideas, and document my ongoing programming journey.  
Here I work through concepts ranging from foundational syntax to object-oriented design and database connectivity.  

📁 **Contents**  
This repository includes programs created throughout my college studies and independent learning.  
Each file reflects steady growth in logic, structure, and understanding of core C# concepts.  

The plan is to expand into database integration and data-driven apps, and eventually include a final project that ties many of these concepts together.

## ▶️ Running the Programs (🚨 Important!)
Each exercise is stored as its own `.cs` file and for simplification and must be run individually.  

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions  
To run any C# program locally from your device, you must first follow these simple steps 👇  

#### **Install & Deploy**:
```
1️⃣ Install the .NET SDK  
👉 [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
Once downloaded, test with CLI command: dotnet --version

2️⃣ Create a New Console Project
dotnet new console -n MyApp
cd MyApp

3️⃣ Replace the Default Program.cs
Insert/build desired script into the freshly generated Program.cs file.

4️⃣ Run the Program
dotnet run
✅ Boom! Your output should appear in the terminal.
```
#### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**:
>> Language: `C#`
>> Framework: `.NET SDK`
>> Editor: `Visual Studio Code`

📘 About
This repository will grow gradually, with new files added after completion or submission.
Some projects are my own, others are assignments designed to solve specific problems.
