# 🧩 Welcome to my C# Sandbox 🩴🩴

## What is it?
> A space to store my C# programs, explore new ideas, and document my ongoing programming journey.  
> Here I work through concepts ranging from foundational syntax to object-oriented design and database connectivity.

---

## Contents
> This repository includes programs created throughout my college studies and independent learning.  
> Each file reflects steady growth in logic, structure, and understanding of core C# concepts.

The plan is to expand into **database integration** and **data-driven apps**, and eventually include a **final project** that ties many of these concepts together.
